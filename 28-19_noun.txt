sex marriage plebiscite isn looking like masterstroke
updated
unless polls massively flawed plebiscite sex marriage deliver big majority change could problem malcolm turnbull given schisms party writes jeff sparrow
victorian law still listed death penalty male homosexual acts
dark times progressives good reminded successes achievements gay lesbian movement quite frankly astonishing hard think social movement shifted attitudes quickly rendering recent past almost unimaginable new generation
let forget tasmania homosexuality remained illegal date law books said gay sex could punished years gaol
context latest schisms within conservative ranks senator eric abetz announcing won necessarily vote line results plebiscite equal marriage senators cory bernardi bridget mckenzie confirming ll voting sex marriage matter community says
understand happening need briefly reprise history sorry debate years upon years politicians trying pander bigotry even public became ever accepting sex rights
reason parliament needs pass laws equal marriage back john howard amended marriage act exclude sex couples
time many pundits thought tremendously cunning way deploying socially conservative workers called howard battlers wedge alp indeed clearly labor assessment instantly supported howard alp explained nicola roxon backed institution marriage men women bedrock institution families
perception sex marriage fringe cause pushed vocal inner city minority loathed ordinary suburbanites persisted throughout labor years
university student julia gillard ran office gay rights platform prime minister however declared cultural traditionalist opposed euthanasia sex marriage basis traditional values
think culture heritage said marriage act marriage man woman special status
calculation presumably needed support australian christian lobby certain socially conservative union leaders needed advocates equality still judged tiny minority course weren contrary every poll showed growing support marriage rights result questions equality dogged gillard throughout tenure
appreciate disastrously gillard manoeuvred corner think might happened enthusiastically embraced marriage reform
argued
labor already introduced reform abbott would face unpalatable choice agreed respect new reality honour sex ceremonies taking place d risk insurgency social conservatives form key liberal constituency people opposition gay marriage remains entirely non negotiable pledged overturn law many religious activists would undoubtedly demand case d promising dissolve unions married couples across land position infinitely confrontational unpalatable simply defending traditional marriage abstract people like barry o farrell already speaking change hard believe liberals libertarian wing would sit quietly abbott went breaking marriages popular support marriage reform words pose huge opportunity gillard correspondingly massive problem abbott yet somehow labor made world pain
abbott took office proceeded sex marriage fringe issue reform obsession twitterati said murdoch pundits perverse crusade inner city elite real australians found either abhorrent irrelevant
pure projection opinion surveys showed actually suburban voters cared little abbott obsessions honour prince phillip said ordinary person ever however support marriage reform consistent majority
suddenly wedgers found wedged conservative wing party would accept reform yet abbott team forced recognise extent public opinion turned find way respond
hence marriage equality plebiscite advocating plebiscite allowed abbott stall reform absolve responsibility debate would primarily take place outside parliament
initially abbott supporters commentariat hailed plan masterstroke perhaps calculating delay would mean plebiscite would fail particularly given low success rate constitutional referendums
something interesting happened polls showed voters liked quite large measure idea popular vote though conservative pundits took evidence abbott genius actually represented something quite different basically years politicians slippery manoeuvres public longer trusted parliamentarians fix mess d created
malcolm turnbull inherited abbott plebiscite revealed another poisoned chalice turnbull likes present sophisticated urbane liberal antithesis abbott style knuckledragger d love prime minister presides historic parliamentary vote marriage reform yet tensions within party fuelled abbott persistent white anting compel proceed plebiscite doesn really want
abetz bernardi interventions illustrate turnbull problems unless polls massively flawed plebiscite deliver big majority change face government refused act would plunged crisis look tony abbott current american trip see extent opposition sex marriage dwindled reactionary rump group former pm addressing says seriousness seeks recover robust christendomic theology third fourth fifth centuries
abetz bernardi seriously think prevent marriage reform indication public wants join abbott trip back third century however stake territory liberals internal ructions positioning leading figures emerging extreme wing party
strategy might pay won pay liberals whole one suspects merely beginning long grinding war within australian conservatism war neither side easily win
australian public made mind wants equal marriage politicians get way suffer consequences

gillard labor government wanted students able access university education see reforms come great cost writes osman faruqi
debate reignited australia university entrance scores reports universities admitting students australia tertiary admissions ranks atars low
even calls abandon current system altogether
let clear one thing past eight years university entrance scores steadily lost kind meaning
prior federal government set cap number places available university course
universities could enrol students cap wouldn receive extra government funding financial incentive enrol students universities generally didn
within context system university entrance scores developed means ration limited number places smartest hardest working students
changed dramatically gillard labor government started phasing demand driven funding caps places abolished universities could enrol many students liked still receiving public funding
government argued great expansion university system would see students ever access university education
point correct university enrolments skyrocketed per cent four years following beginning deregulation student places
actually financial incentive universities enrol students might missed publicised atar cut
re starting find great expansion come cost universities students successive cuts funding labor coalition governments meant teaching learning resources public universities aren keeping pace increasing numbers students
australia currently second lowest funder higher education oecd
universities made gap essentially enrolling students low cost degrees like business teaching supplementing declining government revenue student fees
cap places anymore actually financial incentive universities enrol students might missed publicised atar cut
demand driven funding also linked increased casualisation amongst academic general staff university accountants longer accurately predict student numbers amount staff resources might required
en environment universities compete mercilessly spending millions rebrands order attract students supplementary revenue source regardless university admission score
perhaps doesn matter long students getting education
quality teaching learning universities notoriously difficult quantify one trend crystal clear first year drop rates increased time students atars gained entry university
according government figures one seven students dropping first year highest rate decade
students deserve supported studying used revenue source discarded discover keep
expanding access university worthwhile policy goal students gaining access higher education adequately supported experience high quality learning environment increasing drop rates increasing staff cuts increasing casualisation rates indicate experiencing
years ago many students lower atar scores would enrolled tafe either alternative entry scheme university degree learn trade however two forces acted concert recent years drive students away tafe university
another gillard labor government initiative national skills agreement saw public tafe forced compete private profit education providers government funding combined massive funding cuts policy saw tafe bleed students staffs private college reaped millions public funding
time graduation employment rates collapsed lowest point since recession forcing students consider postgraduate qualifications skills order secure job
vocational education gutted job prospects looking dim isn surprising students turning university system happy scoop return guaranteed government revenue
fact many students derided entering university low atar scores deserve high quality public education whether university tafe

scott morrison would better ignoring peter costello surplus advice

australian economy different position mid last thing need budget advice former treasurer still living past writes greg jericho
one worst aspects economic debate country view budget surplus inherent good signifies good economic management
former treasurer peter costello lead pontificator view weekend suggested budget could back surplus two years government
advice current treasurer scott morrison would well advised completely ignore
last saturday evening former treasurer peter costello decided weigh budget debate speech delivered young liberals canberra costello argued scott morrison seeking return budget surplus two years like
argued government deficit position similar years ago debt position
costello believes problem failure set target stick saying
historical precedent fixing budget position must clearly set goal
alas surprisingly given speaker function analysis lacked great insight surface current budget position might look closer examination shows great differences importantly australian economy different position mid
one would hope current treasurer would dismiss calls akin year olds like telling kids got act gear hottest could lot rock music like
scott morrison looks board costello surplus mania even taken step suggesting good bad surpluses bad surplus morrison view one achieved government expenditure per cent gdp
told sky news
last years one year surplus achieved expenditure gdp quarter economy
wanted split hairs d point also budget surplus spending per cent gdp morrison correct
view surplus achieved expenditure less per cent gdp sustainable surplus based expenditure level achievable rather mimics talk peter costello suggested speech budget problem spending close per cent gdp still temporary emergency level kevin rudd introduced
costello also suggested could get back one starving street levels budget would surplus
men usual ignore revenue side
costello loves recall budget lowest spending time treasurer per cent gdp morrison might think spending per cent somehow bad forget level revenue raised surplus years
sure haven many surpluses expenditure per cent gdp neither many revenue less per cent gdp
costello time treasurer deliver surplus revenue level first
last year revenue higher per cent gdp coincidentally last year budget surplus
nine years costello delivered budget surplus government revenue averaged per cent gdp since averaged per cent gdp even best hopes budget papers revenue expected get per cent gdp
bear mind morrison believes needs come
least morrison unlike costello able see difference economic situation inherits one costello august
take gdp growth four years prior costello began cutting budget deficit australia economy never grew less per cent financial year whereas past three years gdp grown per cent
economy zooming recession whereas still bumping along
budget purpose nominal gdp important figure strong nominal gdp growth correlates strongly revenue growth prior costello first budget nominal gdp growing per cent per cent rising entire period treasurer never grew less per cent
past three years fastest nominal gdp grown per cent grew record low per cent
main reason run surplus private sector growing well deficit would overheat economy causing inflation rise years budget inflation back rise going rba target range per cent good time government cut deficit
inflation rose per cent
among reasons low inflation moment bugger demand economy declining private investment mining sector enough rest economy make
contrast back demand economy going gangbusters time perfect cut deficit indeed alp done previous two years costello took deficit cut per cent gdp per cent gdp costello cut per cent gdp per cent gdp
crucial point moving surplus budget situation one year change previous year
budget designed take momentum economy e reducing deficit increasing surplus designed stimulate economy increasing deficit reducing surplus
reducing deficit way try balance within two years would require slamming fiscal brakes time australian economy barely second gear
even clear look growth real net national disposable income abs measure national economic well
things looking great early mining boom ended past three years seen australia national income stagnate manner usually associated deep recession
current path surplus slow steady path recognises current state australian economy last thing need advice former treasurer still living past

dark noodles stars milky way could missing matter
updated
mysterious lumps gas clouds connecting stars milky way could comprise significant amount galaxy missing matter according australian scientists
key points noodle shaped lumps lie gas stars milky way
discovery challenges understanding gas milky way
lumps gas work like lenses focusing defocusing radio waves
may make substantial amount galaxy dark matter
invisible structures reported journal science thought shaped like noodles lasagne sheets possibly hazelnuts
observations provide us new understanding galaxy interstellar gas important recycling stellar material new star formation said study lead author dr keith bannister csiro
structures appear lumps thin electrically charged gas lies stars galaxy
lumps gas work like lenses focusing defocusing radio waves distant objects making appear strengthen weaken period days weeks months dr bannister said
looking light wine glass move wine glass ll see shape light bulb changing getting brighter fainter
astronomers first detected mysterious clouds years ago saw radio waves bright quasar distant galaxy varying wildly strength
however back scientists trouble working two frequencies look
powerful telescope enabled detailed study gas
using powerful australia compact array telescope dr bannister colleagues able study gas cloud detail passed front quasar called pks constellation sagittarius
new data instead two channels channels dr bannister said
saw two bumps data first got brighter days became much fainter getting brighter finally going back normal
optical light quasar change radio lensing took place indicating optical surveys events would detect
important know much things structure galaxy gas milky way dr keith bannister
authors estimate lens size earth orbit around sun lies approximately light years away
new observations allowed dr bannister colleagues develop first estimates clouds shape
means re able start ruling different geometries objects solid balls gas bent sheets gas like going black white colour dr bannister said
still couple geometries dr bannister colleagues looking including sheets gas seen edge hollow noodle like cylinders
another possibility involves lumps gas shaped like hazelnut comprising spherical shell plasma surrounding core cooler neutral gas gravity providing confinement keep cloud together said
things milky way comprise fair proportion galaxy overall mass
lenses could help explain missing mass problem
dr bannister said lenses could help explain astronomers call missing mass problem
current models nucleosynthesis first minutes big bang billion years ago predict far hydrogen helium lithium produced actually find said
leading candidate hot plasma contained filaments knots web like large scale structure universe lenses provide another candidate

pluto heart shaped sputnik planum region million years old far younger rest dwarf planet according new study
key facts sputnik planum thought ancient basin filled slushy nitrogen ice
astronomers calculate pluto struck large object every million years

smooth surface points sort mysterious internal heat source
findings reported journal plos one based survey impact craters pluto frozen surface seen nasa new horizons spacecraft visit distant world last year
look data sputnik planum region interesting pits shapes aren craters study author dr david trilling northern arizona university flagstaff said
would say right biggest mystery pluto system
astronomers determine age surface amount impact craters surface craters older surface
almost every object solar system covered impact craters except places like earth tectonic plate movements weathering erosion erase impact craters thick atmosphere destroys small meteors reach ground
see craters sputnik planum region pluto something must erasing craters part pluto getting hit like everywhere else solar system dr david trilling
information various telescope surveys past decade tells us less many things crossing pluto orbit guess time many would hit pluto dr trilling said
dr trilling calculated pluto struck asteroid meteoroid kuiper belt object large enough crater seen new horizons spacecraft least every million years
see craters sputnik planum region pluto something must erasing craters sure part pluto getting hit like everywhere else solar system said
means region million years old younger young compared billion year age solar system
slushy ice flow lava lamp could explain young surface
dr trilling said several possible scenarios might explain young surface area
one scenario partly melted slushy ice may flow across surface filling covering craters
pluto average surface temperature minus degrees celsius turns water ice hard enough form dwarf planet bedrock
ice pluto re talking nitrogen ice maybe methane carbon monoxide volatile elements still flow around partly liquid extremely cold temperatures pluto dr trilling said
alternatively ice might bubble deep cooling surface sinking like lava lamp
like earth go pluto interior gets warmer go far get region materials frozen solid surface might slushy partly melted maybe kilometres surface dr trilling said
third option involves possible subterranean cryovolcanoes underneath sputnik planum erupting material slushy water ammonia mix melts nitrogen pushes towards edge sputnik planum region
think certainty ideas likely said dr trilling
