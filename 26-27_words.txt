scott morrison would better ignoring peter costello surplus advice updated australian economy different position mid
last thing need budget advice former treasurer still living past writes greg jericho
one worst aspects economic debate country view budget surplus inherent good signifies good economic management
former treasurer peter costello lead pontificator view weekend suggested budget could back surplus two years government
advice current treasurer scott morrison would well advised completely ignore
last saturday evening former treasurer peter costello decided weigh budget debate speech delivered young liberals canberra
costello argued scott morrison seeking return budget surplus two years like
argued government deficit position similar years ago debt position
costello believes problem failure set target stick saying historical precedent fixing budget position
must clearly set goal
alas surprisingly given speaker function analysis lacked great insight
surface current budget position might look closer examination shows great differences importantly australian economy different position mid
one would hope current treasurer would dismiss calls akin year olds like telling kids got act gear hottest could lot rock music like
scott morrison looks board costello surplus mania even taken step suggesting good bad surpluses
bad surplus morrison view one achieved government expenditure per cent gdp
told sky news last years one year surplus achieved expenditure gdp quarter economy
wanted split hairs d point also budget surplus spending per cent gdp morrison correct view surplus achieved expenditure less per cent gdp sustainable surplus based expenditure level achievable rather mimics talk peter costello suggested speech budget problem spending close per cent gdp still temporary emergency level kevin rudd introduced
costello also suggested could get back one starving street levels budget would surplus
men usual ignore revenue side
costello loves recall budget lowest spending time treasurer per cent gdp morrison might think spending per cent somehow bad
forget level revenue raised surplus years
sure haven many surpluses expenditure per cent gdp neither many revenue less per cent gdp
costello time treasurer deliver surplus revenue level first
last year revenue higher per cent gdp
coincidentally last year budget surplus
nine years costello delivered budget surplus government revenue averaged per cent gdp
since averaged per cent gdp
even best hopes budget papers revenue expected get per cent gdp
bear mind morrison believes needs come
least morrison unlike costello able see difference economic situation inherits one costello august
take gdp growth
four years prior costello began cutting budget deficit australia economy never grew less per cent financial year whereas past three years gdp grown per cent economy zooming recession whereas still bumping along
budget purpose nominal gdp important figure strong nominal gdp growth correlates strongly revenue growth
prior costello first budget nominal gdp growing per cent per cent rising entire period treasurer never grew less per cent
past three years fastest nominal gdp grown per cent grew record low per cent main reason run surplus private sector growing well deficit would overheat economy causing inflation rise
years budget inflation back rise going rba target range per cent
good time government cut deficit
inflation rose per cent among reasons low inflation moment bugger demand economy declining private investment mining sector enough rest economy make contrast back demand economy going gangbusters
time perfect cut deficit indeed alp done previous two years costello took
deficit cut per cent gdp per cent gdp
costello cut per cent gdp per cent gdp
crucial point moving surplus budget situation one year change previous year
budget designed take momentum economy e
reducing deficit increasing surplus designed stimulate economy increasing deficit reducing surplus
reducing deficit way try balance within two years would require slamming fiscal brakes time australian economy barely second gear
even clear look growth real net national disposable income abs measure national economic well
things looking great early mining boom ended
past three years seen australia national income stagnate manner usually associated deep recession current path surplus slow steady path recognises current state australian economy

zika virus next global health crisis

current standby wait watch attitude developed world failing us writes peter curson
survived human drama sars avian flu swine flu ebola headed another infectious disease disaster
zika virus rapidly spreading around world detected australians returning south america may well turn next health crisis
department foreign affairs trade issued new advice warning australians particularly pregnant women reconsider plans travel countries affected virus
zika mosquito borne flavivirus closely related dengue symptoms similar
like dengue chikungunya viruses disease transmitted aedes mosquitoes results rashes fever headaches severe joint pain
case zika one five infected go develop symptoms possibility infection produce microcephaly abnormal smallness head newly born infants
evidence still conclusive little doubt number young children born microcephaly substantially increased countries brazil last year zika spread widely
zika named forest uganda disease first isolated rhesus monkey
first found humans nigeria
looking back last years learnt anything identification control infectious disease outbreaks
much doubt
handful zika cases recorded disease spread rapidly producing number significant outbreaks pacific islands south america south east asia
recently infection also recorded puerto rico cases beginning appear usa uk among travellers returning latin america
large scale outbreak brazil seems commenced virologists linking infection birth defect microcephaly first time
parts latin america women advised postpone becoming pregnant least six months
like many infections disease accompanies international travellers around world particularly spent time latin america pacific islands
allied fact aedes mosquitoes responsible spreading dengue throughout world also widespread parts australia places us risk
also like dengue cure zika treatment simply focuses relieving symptoms
still unclear zika recently relatively rare seems spreading quickly
many believe human mobility intrusion infected areas plays critical role argue increasing temperatures changing breeding pattern distribution mosquito populations may also blame
little doubt living highly mobile world millions people move every day across international borders pursuit holidays education business fleeing natural disasters civil unrest
addition people seeking visit remote rural locations latin america pacific possibly exposing encounters infected mosquitoes
would also seem true increasing temperatures higher frequency tropical downpours may well influence number distribution aedes mosquitoes
tend governed rubric kills us something
whereas debilitates incapacitates tend live
witnessing early stages pandemic progress
epidemic zika break australia would produce reaction fear saw sars avian swine flu
possibly given living dengue well years
hand possible implications mothers giving birth would certainly engender considerable fear apprehension
little doubt infectious disease one major challenges facing world today
looking back last years learnt anything identification control infectious disease outbreaks
much doubt
given experience dengue mosquito borne infections tend governed rubric kills us something
whereas debilitates incapacitates tend live
untrue would cure vaccine dengue decades ago
presumably might apply zika
ebola outbreak west africa also indicated poorly react respond epidemic crises
